# MyReads Project

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

The application also has a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
